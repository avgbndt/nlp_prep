Conduit of Power. The internet plumbing is a tool of corporate and state power. Which is why vested power interests are freaking out about #Huawei. Given that they literally invented #SurveillanceCapitalism I'm not going to be rooting for Google either.
"#Huawei isn't the issue @Jacob_Rees_Mogg but the fact that the US is dictating what countries can and can't do due to them losing the #Tech & #5G race to #China! US Co's like #Amazon, #Apple & #Google are freely stealing our #Data as well as listening in but nothing is done!"
The other thing is that Huawei phones use the Google Android operating system which is hugely American. If you force Huawei into a national disconnect they will create their own software and Silicon Valley will lose a huge market!!!

@MyScriptApps Hello. Logged in to Nebo for Huawei app via my google account on a brand new Huawei Media Pad M5 lite 10. Used original huawei stylus. The app crashed within the first 20 mins of usage and doesn't start even after restarting the tablet. Any recommendations?
Signed on the dotted line and renewed my EE contract for another 3 years with the Huawei p30 pro. I figure a fantastic phone now will be a good one then. The extra battery life will definitely help a big problem I'm currently having with the Google Pixel.

Apple stans are one of my biggest pet peeves. Largely because they're legitimately wrong about their phones being better. Google Pixel has a better camera. Samsung is the #1 brand worldwide. Huawei has literally the best camera on the market on a phone. Apple has cute cases?
